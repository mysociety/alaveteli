# Version 0.5.1

## Highlighted features

This release was mainly to address issue #418, a regression introduced
in 0.5, which was causing deployment problems:

* Setting `STAGING_SITE: 0` in `general.yml` and running
  `script/rails-post-deploy` will ensure the correct behaviour in
  production environments
* It should now be safe to run `rake spec` on a production server

There is one minor new feature in this release: 

* Administrators can follow the auto-login URLs forwarded in emails
  from users who want support, and they will remain logged in as
  themselves.

We now have a most of a Czech translation (thanks Josef Pospisil!)

Finally, this release also addresses a number of small bugs, including
the (potentially) important issue #408.

As usual, there is a [full list of changes on github](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/issues?milestone=9&state=closed)

## Upgrade notes

* On a production server, ensure that `STAGING_SITE` is set to `0`,
  and then run `script/rails-post-deploy` as usual.

# Version 0.5

## Highlighted features
* It should now be possible to develop the software on OSX 
* Base design refactored: CSS simplified and reduced, base design colours removed, now provided in example Alaveteli theme override
* It is now possible to rebuild the xapian index for specific terms, rather than having to drop and rebuild the entire database every time (as previously).  See rake xapian:rebuild_index for more info. 
* When listing authorities, show all authorities in default locale, rather than only those in the currently selected locale.
* Ensure incoming emails are only ever parsed once (should give a performance boost)
* Added a simple rate-limiting feature: restrict the number of requests users can make per day, except if explicitly unrestricted in the admin interface

## Upgrade notes
* **IMPORTANT! We now depend on Xapian 1.2**, which means you may need to install Xapian from backports.  See [issue #159](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/issues/159) for more info.
* Themes created for 0.4 and below should be changed to match the new format (although the old way should continue to work):
  * You should create a resources folder at `<yourtheme>/public/` and symlink to it from the main rails app.  See the `install.rb` in `alaveteli-theme` example theme for details.
  * Your styles should be moved from `general/custom_css.rhtml` to a standalone stylesheet in `<yourtheme>/public/stylesheets/`
  * The partial at `general/_before_head_end.rhtml` should be changed in the theme to include this stylesheet
* [issue #281](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/issues/281) fixes some bugs relating to display of internationalised emails.  To fix any wrongly displayed emails, you'll need to run the script at `script/clear-caches` so that the caches can be regenerated
* During this release, a bug was discovered in pdftk 1.44 which caused it to loop forever.  Until it's incorporated into an official release, you'll need to patch it yourself or use the Debian package compiled by mySociety (see link in [issue 305](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/issues/305))
* Ensure you have values for new config variables (see `config/general.yml-example`):
  * EXCEPTION_NOTIFICATIONS_FROM
  * EXCEPTION_NOTIFICATIONS_TO
* The new optional config variable MAX_REQUESTS_PER_USER_PER_DAY can be set to limit the number of requests each user can make per day.
* The recommended Varnish config has changed, so that we ignore more cookies.  You should review your Varnish config with respect to the example at `config/varnish-alaveteli.vcl`.
* Consider setting elinks global config as described in the "Troubleshooting" section of INSTALL.md

# Version 0.4

## Highlighted features
* Complete overhaul of design, including improved search, modern look and feel, more twitter links, etc
* A banner alerts visitors from other countries to existing sites in their country, or exhorts them to make their own
* Bounce emails that result from user alerts are automatically processed and hard bouncing accounts do not continue to receive alerts.
  See the new instructions in INSTALL-exim4.md for details of how to set this up.
* Logged in users now have the ability to download a zipfile of the entire correspondence for a request
* Improved UI for responding to requests.  The user now has a single option to "reply" at the bottom of a request, and can adjust who they are replying to on the next page

## Upgrade notes
* Remember to `rake db:migrate` and `git submodule update`
* Ensure you have values for new config variables (see `config/general.yml-example`):
  * FORWARD_NONBOUNCE_RESPONSES_TO
  * TRACK_SENDER_EMAIL
  * TRACK_SENDER_NAME
  * HTML_TO_PDF_COMMAND
  * NEW_RESPONSE_REMINDER_AFTER_DAYS
  * FORCE_REGISTRATION_ON_NEW_REQUEST
* The config variable `FRONTPAGE_SEARCH_EXAMPLES` is no longer used, so you should remove it to avoid confusion.
* Execute `script/rebuild-xapian-index` to create new xapian index
  terms used in latest version of search (can take a long time)
* Install wkhtmltopdf to enable PDFs in downloadable zipfiles.  A
  static binary is recommended on Linux in order to run the command
  headless: http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/downloads/list
* Ensure your webserver can serve up generated files by symlinking `cache/zips/download` to `public/download` (this is also done by the `rails-post-deploy` script).  If you're using Passenger + Apache, you'll need to add a `PassengerResolveSymlinksInDocumentRoot on` directive to the configuration.
  * Note that the zipfile download functionality will currently hang if you're running Alaveteli single-threaded, as it creates a new request to the server to get the print stylesheet version!
* Configure your MTA to handle bounce emails from alerts (see INSTALL-exim4.md)

# Version 0.3

## Highlighted features
* New search filters / UI on request page, authorities page, and search page.  Upgrades require a rebuild of the Xapian index (`./script/xapian-index-rebuild`).  Design isn't beautiful; to be fixed in next release.
* Introduce reCaptcha for people apparently coming from foreign countries (to combat spam) (requires values for new config variables `ISO_COUNTRY_CODE` and `GAZE_URL`, and existing config variables `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`)
* Better admin interface for editing multiple translations of a public body at once
