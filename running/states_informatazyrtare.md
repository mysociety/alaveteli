# States of requests

<p class="lead">
  A <a href="{{site.baseurl}}glossary/#request" class="glossary">request</a>
  passes through different <strong>states</strong> as it is processed. These may
  vary from one jurisdiction to another.
</p>

The request states are defined in the Alaveteli code, and we recommend you use
them (provided they match the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}glossary/#foi"
class="glossary">FOI law</a> in your own jurisdiction). But if you do need to
customise them, you can &mdash; see 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}customising/themes">Customising the request states</a> for details.

## InformataZyrtare.org (Kosovo) example

Requests made on Kosovo's Alaveteli instance, [InformataZyrtare](http://informatazyrtare.org), may be in any of the following states
(for comparison, the UK's instance uses 
[slightly different states]({{ site.baseurl }}running/states)):

  TODO: muckrock's states here?

# MuckRock.com

US FOI site MuckRock.com uses the following states:

**Draft**
Unfinished request

**Processing**
The MuckRock team are currently reviewing the request to decide what to do with it.

This is necessary because a lot of requests have to be mailed or faxed or have signatures, etc.  The system requires quite a lot of manual intervention.  Over time the plan is to automate more, but this state will still be required at a minimum to indicate that MuckRock is the holdup, not the requester or the agency.

**Awaiting Response**
Request sent, no reply received yet

**Fix Required**
If the authority or a MuckRock admin thinks that user needs to clarify or otherwise "fix" the request

**Payment Required**
In the US, an authority can ask a user to make a payment to cover the costs of the request

**Rejected**
Request rejected

**No responsive documents**
Information not held

**Completed**
Successfully finished request

**Partially Completed**
Finished request, partly successful
