This is a summary of the docs as we transition them to code.alaveteli.org.
Ultimately:

  * definitive and stable docs end up on code.alaveteli.org (the gh-pages branch),
  * notes and proposed feature discussions, etc., stay on the (github) wiki
  
  

docs: [ok] - it's in the docs                         wiki: [ok] is in the wiki, OK
      [no] - it's not in the docs and should not be         [x ] should not be in wiki, needs redirection
      [  ] - needs attention                                [no] done: it's not live in the wiki anymore
      [??] - needs attention, but not in docs per se        [? ] needs work


These pages (in the wiki) have work/attention still pending:
------------------------------------------------------------

[  ] [  ] Administrator's manual TODO -- needs to be implemented
[no] [??] Caching currently implemented <-- TODO if needed (seems old)
[no] [no] Current project status <-- moved onto the intranet Twiki
[no] [no] Features  -- see https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/issues/1350
[no] [no] I18n approach
[ok] [no] I18n guide      } developers/i18n maybe: see also http://mysociety.github.io/internationalization.html
[no] [ok] Improved document conversion kept on wiki
[ok] [ok] List of foi websites and projects <-- keep non-production alaveteli and non-alaveteli in the wiki, rest are in the site **TODO**: move the alaveteli ones to the Twiki so we keep the repo links (e.g. Hungarian fork on their own github) etc. The rest remain there -- and put a link to the "live" page on http://alaveteli.org/deployments/
[no] [ok] Local customization; Initial setup and administration <-- no info, but good questions: where should this go? (moved into an issue #1651)
[ok] [no] Marking up text for translation <-- needs writing as part of specific Alavateli i18n, but
                                              linking to http://mysociety.github.io/internationalization.html
[>>] [x ] Setting up a demo site <-- TODO should be in the docs, presumably into the EC2/AMI installation page
          The section on Localisation (pulling in Transifex translations) should probably end up in 
          http://alaveteli.org/docs/developers/i18n/#deployment-notes
          since the wiki notes are more detailed than the docs at the moment
