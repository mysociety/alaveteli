This is a summary of the docs as we transition them to code.alaveteli.org.
Ultimately:

  * definitive and stable docs end up on code.alaveteli.org (the gh-pages branch),
  * notes and proposed feature discussions, etc., stay on the (github) wiki
  
  

docs: [ok] - it's in the docs                         wiki: [ok] is in the wiki, OK
      [no] - it's not in the docs and should not be         [x ] should not be in wiki, needs redirection
      [  ] - needs attention                                [no] done: it's not live in the wiki anymore
      [??] - needs attention, but not in docs per se        [? ] needs work


These pages (in the wiki) have work/attention still pending:
------------------------------------------------------------

[  ] [  ] Administrator's manual TODO -- needs to be implemented
[no] [??] Caching currently implemented <-- TODO if needed (seems old)
[no] [ok] Current project status <-- but TODO facts from here prob should be represented on the .org site
[??] [  ] Features <-- not sure this is for documentation, but is for the website -- see https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/issues/1350
[no] [x?] I18n approach -- seems out of date, since gettext is used now, but provides historical justification for how this was done (linked-to from i18n in wiki)
[  ] [  ] I18n guide      } developers/i18n maybe: see also http://mysociety.github.io/internationalization.html
[??] [do] Improved document conversion <-- some of this needs to go into docs, some is a proposal
[??] [ok] List of foi websites and projects <-- perhaps should be in the site, but not really a docs issue just now
[??] [x ] Local customization; Initial setup and administration <-- no info, but good questions: where should this go?
[>>] [? ] Marking up text for translation <-- needs writing as part of specific Alavateli i18n, but
                                              linking to http://mysociety.github.io/internationalization.html
[>>] [no] Setting up a demo site <-- TODO should be in the docs, a useful page with some overlap




These pages are all effetively done (i.e., definitively settled in the docs)
