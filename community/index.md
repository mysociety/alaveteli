The Alaveteli Community
====================

<p class="lead">
  If you are running an Alaveteli installation &mdash; or are thinking of setting one up &mdash; let the community help.
</p>

We actively help people set up and run Alaveteli instances all around the
world. Alaveteli is more than just software, it's also a community of people
who care enough about <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/docs/glossary/#foi"
class="glossary__link">Freedom of Information</a> to build and run sites to benefit
the public.

If you're just starting out, or you've already got your site up and running,
this page points you at the places you can find out more, ask questions, or
just say hi.


## Project mailing list

Sign up for the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/alaveteli-dev">Alaveteli project mailing list</a> &mdash; feel free to ask questions. Lots of helpful people are on it
&mdash; not just mySociety staff but also people (like you!) running their own
sites.

The archives are a good source of information too. If you've got a problem, it's
always worth checking to see if someone has already solved it.

It you're just starting out, saying hello on the mailing list is a great way to
begin <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/img/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)">

## mySociety international team

mySociety has very limited capacity to run a handful of Alaveteli sites for willing volunteers. Contact our <a href="mailto:international@mysociety.org">international team</a> for more information.

## IRC

### irc.mysociety.org #mschat

**`#mschat`** &mdash;
the mySociety developers can be found on IRC in `#mschat` on
`irc.mysociety.org` (running on port `6667`, and also `9219`)
(also available via this [web interface](http://www.irc.mysociety.org)).

### irc.freenode.net #alaveteli

**`#alaveteli`** &mdash;
there's an `#alaveteli` channel on
[Freenode](http://freenode.net) (`irc.freenode.net`) ...although that channel can be rather quiet

## Code and issues on github

The [Alaveteli software is on github](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli) and we actively use
[github's issues](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli) &mdash; sometimes there's discussion on specific issues in there too, which can be handy (especially if it's an issue you've raised).

## Documentation

Although asking a human is great, often what you want to know can be
found in the documentation:

* [this documentation]({{ page.baseurl }}/docs/) &mdash; always the first place to look
* [the dev wiki](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/wiki) &mdash; informal or specific notes
* [docs in the repo](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/tree/rails-3-develop/doc) (although we're slowly phasing these out in favour of the docs you're reading now)
