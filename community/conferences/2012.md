title: AlaveteliCon 2012
---


<h1>AlaveteliCon 2012</h1>
AlaveteliCon 2012 was the first ever conference to bring together developers and users of Alaveteli, the international Right to Know software.

In April 2012, the Alaveteli project had been running for over a year. It was running in seven countries worldwide, with at least seven more planned.

The original idea behind AlaveteliCon was to consolidate the small community that had been built around the software. In this way we could keep collaborating, and to make the software and its impact on FOI even greater.

Thanks to generous funding from Open Society Foundation and Hivos, the scope grew to include more than 50 people from over 30 countries, many of whom were not current Alaveteli users.

The conference assembled a range of FOI practioners and civic society hackers that are rarely in one place together. It was a great opportunity to make progress on Alaveteli and also to improve our understanding of the international FOI scene.

<h3>David Cabo</h3>
<img class="l" src="{{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/goteo-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" />I'm vice-president of Pro Bono Publico - a Spanish association organizing the biggest Open Data hackathon in the country, AbreDatos - and creator of dondevanmisimpuestos.es, a web site for visualizing the annual budgets from Spanish public administrations, developed in collaboration with the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN). I worked with mySociety and Access Info Europe in the development of the EU access to information site, AsktheEU.org. I launched the transparency initiative #adoptaundiputado (Adopt an MP) to crowdsource the parsing of Spanish parliamentarians' financial disclosure reports, and have collaborated with investigative journalists in the extraction and analysis of public records (Looting the Seas, ICIJ). I'm currently working on tuderechoasaber.es, an access to information site for Spain based on the Alaveteli software and funded by more than 150 small donors using the crowdfunding platform Goteo.

<h3>Seb Bacon</h3>
<img class="l" src="{{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/seb-197x300.jpg" alt="" width="197" height="300" />I'm the project lead for Alaveteli.  I've been making websites for the not for profit sector for 12 years.  I'm a coder and a manager.  I used to run a web agency, then I took a long break, and when I got back did consulting jobs for a few different charities and companies.  I've made some interesting democracy websites and odd (and generally unsuccessful) attempts at online commercial wheezes. About a year ago, I took the software for WhatDoTheyKnow and turned it into Alaveteli, and I've been working on it since then as part of mySociety, with funding from the Open Society Foundation and the Hivos Foundation.  I like doing lots of different things, but especially being a dad, dancing, vegan cooking, travelling, archaeology, and farming.

Previously he worked with Latin American governments and civil society organizations on these issues and also in civil service reform initiatives, and also set up a youth participation programme in Uruguay (a.k.a. as home). Currently he is part of a great team of which is setting up an organisation in Uruguay that will harness the power of open data to foster social change (and that is why alaveteli seems like such a cool thing) . Other than that, he enjoys tramping (hiking) tango and scuba diving.

<h3>Romina Colman</h3>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/Alaveteli-pic-221x300.png" alt="" width="221" height="300" class="l" />
I’ m a student from the University of Buenos Aires and a dedicated activist for FOI in Latin America. I have filed for over 100 requests in different countries, including Argentina, Chile and Mexico. I love researching about electronic and paper systems for FOI to find out what are their strengths and weaknesses in order to understand how can we get this right closer to civil society. I´m curious and non-stop learner. I believe that Alaveteli has the power to change the relationship between Argentine government and citizenship and promote the law in FOI at national level. My passion? Opening archives and working for transparency.

I am a British advertising executive who moved to Prague in 1993, and became involved with business ethics and transparency.

I'm completely IT-illiterate, and I don't speak Czech well enough to front the campaign, so my role is to strike an 'eminence grise' pose, chivvy everyone else along, and buy the beers!

<h3>Andreas Pavlou</h3>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}assets/img/website-photo-andreas2.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="245" class="l" />
I’m a postgrad at the moment, but the world of access to information was brought to my attention whilst working with Access Info Europe as an intern. Since then I have helped to manage and moderate the AsktheEU.org website, launched on International Right to Know Day 2011, which uses the Alaveteli software to help citizens make requests to bodies and institutions of the European Union.
My knowledge of coding and programming is non-existent (bar a couple of html codes) but moderating and managing AsktheEU.org has taught me a lot about how the software works, what can be improved, how effective it can be as well as how needed it is in many places around the world.
I currently live in London, am interested in public participation, all things Hispanic, and will be writing my Masters thesis on the recent mobilisations in Spain and Greece.
