# See http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html for documentation on how to use the robots.txt file

# Mainly to reduce server load from bots, we block pages which are actions, and
# searches. We also block /feed/, as RSS readers (rightly, I think) don't seem
# to check robots.txt.

# This file uses the non-standard extension characters * and $, which
# are supported by Google and Yahoo! and the 'Allow' directive, which
# is supported by Google.
