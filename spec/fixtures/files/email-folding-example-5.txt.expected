Hi Simon

My apologies for timescale of response. The data forwarded is a public
register, and is updated on a frequent and regular basis; your request
unfortunately coincided with annual leave and a monthly update of the
spreadsheet. As the definition of an HMO under the Housing Act 2004
differs to that under planning legislation, I have forwarded this and
your original request on to Andy England, Development Control Manager to
respond independantly.

If I can be of further assistance please contact me
