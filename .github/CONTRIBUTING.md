# Issues

* We try to keep the list of open issues to a reasonably low number of things that we have active plans to work on. Usually this means they're part of a project mySociety has funding for. Other issues usually get closed as "not planned". This doesn't mean they're undesirable or invalid, but just that we can't commit to working on them in the near future. We still comment on these issues (e.g. to record new thoughts/ideas/context), and others are welcome to work on them and propose fixes/pull requests etc.

# Pull Requests

* It's assumed that Pull Requests in a draft state are still being worked on, so won't actively be reviewed. You're more than welcome to @mention someone to request specific feedback though.
* Once Pull Requests are ready to review, mark them as "Ready for review" using GitHub's button for this. We can't promise timelines for review as sometimes our capacity can be quite stretched, but we'll try to provide feedback as soon as we can.
