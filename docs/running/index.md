<p class="lead">
  Keeping your Alaveteli site up and running requires some ongoing effort.
</p>

Alaveteli is not just software. To run a successful

site, you need to make sure day-to-day tasks get done too. Most Alaveteli sites
are run by a team who allocate some time every day to user support and generally keeping
the project up to date.

  what you need to do and know to run your site

* The [redaction guide]({{ page.baseurl }}/docs/running/redaction/) includes some
  examples of Alaveteli's ability to redact sensitive information

* We've prepared a checklist of
  [things to consider]({{ page.baseurl }}/docs/running/server/)
