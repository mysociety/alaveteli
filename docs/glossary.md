    The <strong>admin interface</strong> allows users who have
    <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/docs/glossary/#super" class="glossary__link">super</a>
    administrator privilege to manage some aspects of how your
    Alaveteli site runs.
    <div class="more-info">
      <p>More information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can access your installation's <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/docs/glossary/#admin" class="glossary__link">admin interface</a>
          at <code>/admin</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          To grant a user admin privilege, log into the admin and change
          their <em>Admin level</em> to "super" (or revoke the privilege
          by changing it to "none").
        </li>
        <li>
          On a newly-installed Alaveteli system, you can grant yourself

    <strong>Alaveteli</strong> is the name of the open source software platform created
    by <a href="https://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a> for submitting,
    managing and archiving Freedom of Information requests.
    <p>
      It grew from the successful FOI UK project
      <a href="#wdtk" class="glossary__link">WhatDoTheyKnow</a>.
      We use the name <em>Alaveteli</em> to distinguish the software
      that runs the platform from any specific website that it is powering.
    </p>
    <div class="more-info">
      <p>More information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Alaveteli website is at <a href="http://www.alaveteli.org">www.alaveteli.org</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          The name "Alaveteli" comes from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaveteli,_Finland">Alaveteli in Finland</a>
          where
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Chydenius">an early FOI campaigner</a>
          once worked.
        </li>

  <dt>
    <a name="agnostic">asker agnostic</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <a href="#foi" class="glossary__link">Freedom of Information</a> (FoI) law typically considers
    the <a href="#response" class="glossary__link">responses</a> given by the
    <a href="#authority" class="glossary__link">authorities</a> to be <strong>asker agnostic</strong>. This means
    that the reply should not be any different depending on <em>who</em> asked for the
    information. One consequence of this is that the response
    can be <a href="#publish" class="glossary__link">published</a>, because in theory <em>everyone</em>
    could ask for it and expect, by law, to receive the same information.
    <p>
      Despite this, it's still very common all around the world for authorities to reply
      to FoI requests privately, instead of publishing their responses themselves. One of the
      functions of Alaveteli is, therefore, to act as a public repository of published answers.
      This also serves to reduce duplicate requests, by publishing the answer instead of
      requiring it to be asked again.
    </p>

  <dt>
    <a name="authority">authority</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    An <strong>authority</strong> is the term we use for any of the bodies, organisations,
    departments, or companies to which users can send <a href="#request" class="glossary__link">requests</a>.
    <div class="more-info">
      <p>More information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An <a href="#super" class="glossary__link">administrator</a>
          can add, edit, or remove authorities in the admin.
        </li>
        <li>
          Authorities are usually, but not always, public bodies that are obliged by the local
          <a href="#foi" class="glossary__link">Freedom of Information</a> (FoI) law to respond. Sometimes an
          Alaveteli site is set up in a jurisdiction that does not yet have FoI law. In the UK,
          we add some authorites to our <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com">WhaDoTheyKnow</a>
          site that are not subject to FoI law, but which have either voluntarily submitted themselves
          to it, or which we believe should be accountable in this way.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can organise your authorities using

    <a name="blackhole">black hole</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A <strong>black hole</strong> is an email address that accepts and destroys
    any email messages that are sent to it. Alaveteli uses this for "do not
    reply" emails, which are usually automatically generated system emails.
    </p>

    You can arrange your <a href="#authority" class="glossary__link">authorities</a>
    into <strong>categories</strong> so that they are easier for your users
    to find. For example, you might put all different schools into the
    "School" category, and universities into "Universities". You can also
    group categories under headings (such as "Education").
   <p>
     These categories and headings appear on the list of public authorities that
     is displayed on your site.
   </p>
    <p>
      Use <a href="#tag" class="glossary__link">tags</a> to associate

   The categorisation game is a way that users of an Alaveteli site  can help the site stay current and accurate by updating the status of old requests where the original requester has never said whether the authority responded with the information or not.

    <a name="development">development site</a> (also: dev, development server)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    A <strong>dev server</strong> is one that is running your Alaveteli site
    so you can <a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/docs/customising/">customise it</a>, experiment
    with different settings, and test that it does what you expect.
    This is different from a
    <a href="#production" class="glossary__link">production server</a>, which is the one your
    users actually visit running with live data, or a
    <a href="#staging" class="glossary__link">staging server</a>,
    which is used for testing code before it goes live.
    <p>
      On your dev server, you should set
      <code><a href="{{site.baseurl}}docs/customising/config/#staging_site">STAGING_SITE</a></code>
      to <code>1</code>.

    Some <a href="#authority" class="glossary__link">authorities</a> routinely
    publish their responses to <a href="#foi" class="glossary__link">Freedom of
    Information</a> requests online. This collection of responses is called a
    <strong>disclosure log</strong>, and if an authority has such a log on its
    website, you can add the URL so Alaveteli can link to it.
    <div class="more-info">
      <p>More information:</p>

  <dd>
    Alaveteli ships with a configuration setting for an <strong>emergency user</strong>.
    This provides a username and password you can use to access the admin, even though
    the user doesn't appear in the database.
    <p>
      When the system has been bootstrapped (that is, you've used the emergency user to
      grant a user account full <em>super</em> privileges), you must disable the emergency
      user.

    <div class="more-info">
      <p>More information:</p>
      <ul>

    <strong>Freedom of information</strong> laws allow access by the general public

    We use a popular source code control system called <strong>git</strong>. This
    helps us track changes to the code, and also makes it easy for other people
    to duplicate and even contribute to our software.
    <p>
      The website <a href="https://github.com/mysociety">github.com</a> is a central, public
      place where we make our software available. Because it's Open Source, you can
      inspect the code there (Alaveteli is mostly written in the programming language
      Ruby), report bugs, suggest features and many other useful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entire set of files that form the Alaveteli platform is called the
      <strong>git repository</strong> or <strong>repo</strong>. When you
      install Alaveteli, you are effectively cloning our repository on your
      own machine.

    The <strong>holding pen</strong> is the conceptual place where responses
    that could not be delivered are held. They need attention from an
    <a href="#super" class="glossary__link">administrator</a>.
    <p>
      In fact, the holding pen is really a special "sticky" <a href="#request"
      class="glossary__link">request</a> that only exists to accept unmatched
      responses. Whenever Alaveteli receives an email but can't work out which
      request it is a response to, it attaches it to the holding pen instead.

          instructions on what to do with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common reason for a response to be in the holding pen is that
          an <a href="#authority" class="glossary__link">authority</a> replied
          to a request with the wrong email address (for example, by copying

    <a name="i18n">internationalisation</a> (also: i18n)
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <strong>Internationalisation</strong> is the way Alaveteli adapts the
    way it presents text based on the language or languages that your website
    supports. It's sometimes abbreviated as <em>i18n</em> (because there are
    18 letters between i and n).
    <p>
      Often you don't need to worry about the details of how this is done
      because once you've configured your site's
      <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}docs/customising/config/#default_locale">DEFAULT_LOCALE</a></code>
      Alaveteli takes care of it for you.
      But when you do need to work on i18n (for example, if you're customising
      your site by
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}docs/customising/translation/">translating</a> it, or
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}docs/running/admin_manual/#creating-changing-and-uploading-public-authority-data">uploading names</a>
      of the public bodies in more than one language) at the very least you may
      need to know the language codes you're site is using.

    A <strong>Mail Transfer Agent</strong> is the the program which actually sends
    and receives email. Alaveteli sends email on behalf of its users, and processes
    the <a href="#response" class="glossary__link">responses</a> and replies it receives.
    All this email goes through the MTA, which is a seperate service on your system.

    <strong>Redacting</strong> means removing or hiding part of a message so it
    cannot be read: you are effectively removing part of a document from
    your site.
    <p>
      This may be necessary for a variety of reasons. For example, a user may
      accidentally put personal information into their request, or an
      authority may include it in their response. You may also need to
      redact parts of requests or responses that are libellous or legally
      sensitive.

    A <strong>regular expression</strong> is a concise way to describe a
    pattern or sequence of characters, letters or words. As an administrator,
    you may find regular expressions useful if you need to define <a
    href="#censor-rule" class="glossary__link">censor rules</a>. For example, instead
    of <a href="#redact" class="glossary__link">redacting</a> just one specific
    phrase, you can describe a whole range of <em>similar</em> phrases with one
    single regular expression.
    <p>
      Regular expressions can be complicated, but also powerful. If you're not
      familiar with using them, it's easy to make mistakes. Be careful!
