# Welcome to Alaveteli!

This is an open source project to create a standard, internationalised
platform for making Freedom of Information (FOI) requests in different
countries around the world. The software started off life as
[WhatDoTheyKnow](http://www.whatdotheyknow.com), a website produced by
[mySociety](http://mysociety.org) for making FOI requests in the UK.

We hope that by joining forces between teams across the world, we can
all work together on producing the best possible software, and help
move towards a world where governments approach transparency as the
norm, rather than the exception.

Please join our mailing list at
https://groups.google.com/group/alaveteli-dev and introduce yourself.

Some documentation can be found in the [`doc/` folder](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/tree/master/doc).  There's
background information and a little more documentation on
[our wiki](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/wiki/Home/), and
hopefully we'll make [our homepage](http://alaveteli.org) more useful
in due course.
