Give a better login dialog

Tidy up error message text (like "body must be filled in") on info request form

Redirect the front page to the new FOI request page
Make it say "dear" as default letter

Write some tests (try it their way, at every level)

Tidying
=======

If just summary/title is blank says "Info request must be filled in" as spurious extra error
If summary is blank, says "title must be filled in" grrrr

Rename "file_request" controller to "new" ?
Set "null" and "default" options more in schema
Add SQL foreign keys to database schema
    execute 'ALTER TABLE researchers ADD CONSTRAINT fk_researchers_departments FOREIGN KEY ( department_id ) REFERENCES departments( id ) '

Call "delete from sessions where now() - updated_at > 3600" (one hour) or whatever
