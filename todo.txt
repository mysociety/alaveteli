Tidying

Legal/privacy
=============

Check act to see if can use pseudonym for FOI request?
"We will not reveal your email address to anybody" - are there circumstances
 (e.g. somebody messaging creator of a request and it bouncing) where we
 may reasonably do this, and should say it may happen?

Maybe we SHOULD reveal their email to the public body, why not?
