     Dear Humberside Police Authority,

     I am making a request for all the information to which I am
     entitled under the Freedom Of Information Act. In order to assist
     you with this request, I am outlining my query as specifically as
     possible. If however this request is too wide or too unclear, I
     would be grateful if you could contact me by e-mail, as I
     understand that under the act, you are required to advise and
     assist requesters.

     I would like to know:

     1) How many former officers of the Humberside Police force are
     currently in receipt of an injury award pension, as provided for in
     the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 and the Police (Injury
     Benefit) Regulations 2006?

     2) Do you operate a policy of reducing an injury award pension to
     the lowest permissible band when the former officer reaches the age
     of 65?

     3) In the years 2004 to 2008 inclusive, how many former officers’
     injury award pensions were reduced to the lowest banding upon the
     former officer reaching the age of 65? (A total figure only is
     requested, but I have no objection if you break the figures down by
     year)

     4) In the years 1987 to 2003 inclusive, how many former officers’
     injury award pensions were reduced to the lowest banding upon the
     former officer reaching the age of 65? (A total figure only is
     requested, but I have no objection if you break the figures down by
     year)

     5) In the years 2004 to 2008 inclusive, how many formal complaints
     have been made against officers of ACPO rank in the Humberside
     Police force regarding matters in any way connected with the
     administration of reviews of police injury awards? (A total figure
     only is requested, but I have no objection if you break the figures
     down by year)

     I understand that under the FOI Act, I should be entitled to a
     response within 20 working days. I look forward to hearing from you
     in the near future.

     Please note that your full reply to the above questions should be
     sent by e-mail to the return address shown in the heading to this
     message. This is because both the request and its response are
     published for public scrutiny on the web site through which this
     request has been made.

     Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

     Mr. John Jarman
