Dear Ms Peters Rock, 

You requested your correspondence to be treated under the Freedom of
Information Act.  However, as your correspondence asked for general
information, rather than requesting recorded information or documentation,
I should advise you that on this occasion we have not considered your
correspondence under the provisions of the Act.

I am sorry I cannot be more helpful.

Yours sincerely, 
Simon Dove
Customer Service Centre
Department of Health
