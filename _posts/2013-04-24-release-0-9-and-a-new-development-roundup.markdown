We've just released Alaveteli 0.9 - hopefully the last release before we upgrade to Rails 3. The last few months have meant a bunch of behind the scenes upgrades, bugfixes and refactorings to get us to this point - with some highlights being:



	
  * Alaveteli now has better support for running entirely over SSL - as can be seen at [WhatDoTheyKnow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com) and the new Australian [Right to Know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/) site.




	
  * Upgrade to HTML 5



	
  * Preliminary support for running under ruby 1.9 (full support to come with the Rails 3 upgrade)



	
  * Better isolation and testing of the mail handling code



	
  * A more consistent admin user interface using Bootstrap by default



	
  * Better support for responsive front end themes and sqlite on the back end



	
  * A clearer and more consistent format for translations





Thanks to everyone who's contributed!
