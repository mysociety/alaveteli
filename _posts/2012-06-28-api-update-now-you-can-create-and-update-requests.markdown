Version 0.6.1 of the software was recently released with an urgent security update.  Also included in this release was an extension of Alaveteli's API, which allows developers to write apps that create and update requests on a per-public body basis.  There's the start of some documentation [on the wiki](https://github.com/sebbacon/alaveteli/wiki/API).
