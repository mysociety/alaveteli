It's been a long time since the last post, but we've been busy! We've just released Alaveteli 0.6.8. A full list of changes is [available on github](https://github.com/mysociety/alaveteli/blob/master/doc/CHANGES.md). For developers, there are a couple of bits of good news - Alaveteli can now be easily deployed using [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano), and has support for using [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) as an MTA, as well as Exim. Both of these features come courtesy of [@matthewlandauer](https://twitter.com/matthewlandauer) and [@henaredegan](https://twitter.com/henaredegan) of the [Open Australia Foundation](http://www.openaustraliafoundation.org.au/), who are getting very close to launching their own Alaveteli-based FOI site.
