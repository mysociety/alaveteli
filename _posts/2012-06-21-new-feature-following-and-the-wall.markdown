You've always been able to subscribe to email alerts about requests.  However, since WhatDoTheyKnow (the predecessor to Alaveteli) was first conceived, [certain](http://www.facebook.com) [well-known](http://twitter.com) websites have become the primary way many of us interact with the internet.  So we decided to use some of their technology.  Instead of subscribing to alerts, you now follow topics.  And when you follow a topic, by default this still means you get email; but you can turn email alerts off, and choose to view updates on a new "wall" area.

Here's the _"Follow"_ button:

...and here's the "wall":
