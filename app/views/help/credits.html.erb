    <dd>Oh, nearly everyone (and <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/helpus">maybe you too</a>)! 
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.yrtk.org">Heather Brooke</a> 
          (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/mar/29/houseofcommons.michaelmartin?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=worldnews">vampy!</a>) has
          been pushing the idea of a UK FOI archive for years now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both Phil Rodgers and <a href="http://www.flourish.org/blog/">Francis Irving</a>
          entered it in a mySociety competition for ideas for public interest websites to build.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2006/09/27/the-mysociety-call-for-proposals-the-winner-and-runners-up/">It won</a>, 
          and then Chris Lightfoot (<a href="http://mk.ucant.org/archives/000129.html">RIP :(</a>) 
          thought up the wheeze of intercepting email responses to requests and
          automatically publishing them.  
        </li>
        <li>
          Tom Steinberg got the cash to pay for the site from
          <a href="http://www.jrrt.org.uk/">a dead chocolate mogul</a> (<em>thank you!</em>) ...
        </li>
        <li>
          ... so that Francis Irving, Angie Ahl, Tommy Martin, Louise Crow, Matthew Somerville
          and Tom Steinberg could do the complex mixture of design and coding to build
          what you see today. 
        </li>
        <li> 
          Thanks particularly to Julian Todd (<a href="http://www.freesteel.co.uk/wpblog/">great blog!</a>), 
          Francis Davey, and Etienne Pollard for using the site early on and giving
          feedback (and/or legal advice!), and also to all our other users and
          testers.  
        </li>
        <li>
          The amazing team of volunteers who run the site, answer your support
          emails, maintain the database of public authorities and 
          <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2009/10/13/behind-whatdotheyknow/">so much more</a>.
          Thanks to John Cross, Ben Harris, Adam McGreggor, Alex Skene,
          Richard Taylor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Volunteers who have provided patches to the code - thanks Peter Collingbourne
          and Tony Bowden. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Everyone who has helped look up FOI email addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
          We couldn't do any of this without those
          <a href="http://www.ukcod.org.uk/UKCOD_Trustees">crazy people</a> who volunteer,
          amongst many other things, to do the accounts and fill in our VAT return.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, all the officers and servants who have answered the many requests
          made through the site. Their diligence, patience and professionalism is
          what has actually made the information that you see here. Thank them for
          helping make Government more transparent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      You're all stars.
