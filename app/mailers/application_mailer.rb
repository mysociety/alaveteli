  # Note:
  # - We set Return-Path, so you should always set Reply-To to be different
  #   from From, since some email clients seem to erroneously use the envelope
  #   from when they shouldn't, and this might help. (Have had mysterious
  #   cases of a reply coming in duplicate from a public body to both From and
  #   envelope from).
  # - Return-Path is a special address we control so that SPF checks are done
  #   on it.
  # - When sending emails from one user to another, do not set envelope from
  #   address to the from_user, so they can't get someone's email addresses
  #   from transitory bounce messages.
