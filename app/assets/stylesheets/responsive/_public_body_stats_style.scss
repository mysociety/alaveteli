  set in the style attribute in Flot's Javascript to the same
  colour as the grid background. Changing this requires quite
  invasive changes to the Javascript, and is likely to be
  irrelevant in the next version of Flot anyway, which will have
  core support for axis labels.  So, just use !important to make
  the axes black rather than transparent grey for the moment: */
