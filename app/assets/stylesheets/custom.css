/* Themes will typically add a custom.css file with their own CSS.
   This file is present to stop errors where THEME_URLS is empty,
   since it is mentioned in the application.css manifest.  Themes
   should prepend their directories to the asset path so this will
   be overriden by any custom.css in the theme. */
