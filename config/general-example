 * Example values for the "general" config file.
 *
 * Configuration parameters, in PHP syntax. Configuration parameters are set
 * using the PHP define('OPTION_...', '...') function. Both perl and PHP code
 * parse this properly, so you can use comments and conditionals and whatnot,
 * but unless essential it's better to keep it simple....
 *
 * Copy this file to one called "general" in the same directory.  Or
 * have multiple config files and use a symlink to change between them.
 *
 * NOTE ON USE IN RAILS: So that people don't have to have PHP installed just
 * to run this stuff, by convention we always provide a default config value
 * in the source code when reading the config option. The Rails application
 * should run fine without the general config file, it is a bug if it does not.
